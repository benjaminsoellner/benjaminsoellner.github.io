This is my personal blog. Over time, I will share some personal projects:

* Data Science projects, especially those from the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](dand)
* IT Integration projects and experiences with [IBM Integration Products](iic)
* Observations and oppinions on other IT trends around Industry 4.0 and Big Data
* Multimedia side projects (photography and videography)
* Product reviews

You may also find the occasional story about my travels and life in
the international trekking or dancing scene.

If you want to share your insights or ideas, do not hestitate to get in touch.
